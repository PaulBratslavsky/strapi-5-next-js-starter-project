# Strapi 5 and Next.15 Project Example

## Getting Started With The Project Demo

The first step is to clone the project to your local computer and run the setup script.

I will be using GitHub CLI for this example. Let's start by cloning the project with the following command.

``` bash
  git clone https://github.com/PaulBratslavsky/strapi-5-next-js-starter-project.git
```

Once you have the project in you local machine, let's install the project dependencies and seed with example data.

We will run the following command from the root of our project.

``` bash
  yarn setup
```

You can checkout the `package.json` file for more details on what the script will do.
